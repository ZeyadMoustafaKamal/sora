### Sora by me
So I was downloading an anime episode when I found out that I take like 35 secs for every episode. So I decided to spend a couple of days to automate this. My time is valuable!!!


### How to use
1. clone the repo
2. run `uv sync`
3. run `just run` or if you don't have `just` you can use `uv run src/cli.py`


### Important
- First I only get some videos from some random website. If you are someone who thinks that I am violating the copywrite laws then just tell me and I will delete this.
- Second this project is very WIP. In this state I would recomment that you read the scripts and figure out how to deal with it. I will still provide a way to choose the quality and I will try to add a search functionality and maybe I will create a TUI to make this even more easy to use. I only need some time. But of course a PR will be very welcomed.
