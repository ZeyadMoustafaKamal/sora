### Sora by me
So I was downloading an anime episode when I found out that I take like 35 secs for every episode. So I decided to spend a couple of days to automate this. My time is valuable!!!


### How to use
1. clone the repo.
2. run `uv sync`.
3. run `just run --help` or if you don't have `just` you can use `uv run -m sora --help`.


### Important
- Firstly, I only get some videos from some random website. If you think that I am violating the copywrite law then just tell me and I will delete this.
- Secondly, this project is very WIP. In this state I would recommend that you read the scripts and figure out how to deal with it. I will still provide a way to choose the quality and I will try to add a search functionality and maybe I will create a TUI to make this easier to use. I only need some time. But of course a PR will be very welcomed.
- Thirdly, for now everything is being pushed to the main branch. This will be the case until we have a functional CLI. We are almost there but until we reach this, we will always use the main branch.
